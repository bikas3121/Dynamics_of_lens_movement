# Dynamics_of_lens_movement
The Matlab code and the report on the modeling and simulation of the to and fro motion of the lens movement.

To start the simulation, the main.m file should run. Also, the parameters can be varied as required. 
The function files "u_opt.m" and "odecalculator.m" are supplementary function files to run the main file "main.m".
